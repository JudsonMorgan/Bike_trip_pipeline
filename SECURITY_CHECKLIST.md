# Security Checklist for Zoomcamp Data Pipeline

This checklist summarizes security best practices implemented in this project.

---

## Credentials Management

- [x] Service Account Keys are never committed to Git.
- [x] Keys stored locally at `~/.gcp/gcp-key.json`
- [x] `.gitignore` configured to exclude sensitive files.

---

## GCP Best Practices

- [x] Old service account keys deleted from GCP Console.
- [x] Rotated keys immediately after accidental exposure.
- [x] IAM roles follow the principle of least privilege.

---

## Local Environment Management

- [x] Environment variables managed via `.env`
- [x] Environment variables loaded into Airflow and dbt.
- [x] Keys are never hardcoded in code files.

---

## Git Hygiene

- [x] Used `git filter-branch` to clean sensitive files from history.
- [x] `.gitignore` includes all sensitive patterns.
- [x] Forced push cleaned history to GitHub.

---

## Pipeline Orchestration Security

- [x] Airflow config excludes secrets in code.
- [x] dbt `profiles.yml` references keyfile from environment.
- [x] Looker Studio uses BigQuery datasets with limited read access.

---

## Future Improvements (Optional)

- [ ] Use Google Cloud Secret Manager for key storage.
- [ ] Enable Audit Logging on GCP services.
- [ ] Implement CI/CD secrets management (GitHub Actions Secrets).

## Summary

Security is not a one-time task â€” it's an ongoing responsibility.

This project follows modern Data Engineering security practices.

Stay Secure. Stay Pro. ðŸš€
